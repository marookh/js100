Initialize a variable **weather** with a string value being "sunny", "rainy", or anything else.

Write an **if** statement that logs:



```JavaScript
let weather = 'snow storm'; // 'sunny', 'rainy', ...
switch (weather) {
  case 'sunny':
    console.log("It's a beautiful day!");
    break;
  case 'rainy':
    console.log('Grab your umbrella.');
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Let's stay inside.");
}

```

### Discussion
Our switch statement evaluates the provided expression, weather, and when it finds a case clause matching the value of that expression, the code within that case clause is executed. If the value of the provided expression does not match any case clause, the default clause is executed.

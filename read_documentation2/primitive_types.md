## Solution

Data type are the core components of a programming language. Different data types represents different kinds of data. Data types help programmer and their program determine what can and cannot do with that data type. 

JavaScript has five so-called **primitive data types**:
* String
* Number
* Null
* Undefined
* Boolean

There are two more data types which are added in the ES6 version of JavaScript as **primitive data types**:
* BigInt
* Symbol

### Solution 

The output will be **undefined**.

### Discussion

If our array consists 4 elements, and we try to access the fifth element which should be in index position 4, then the return value will be `undefined`, since there is no element in that index. For instance: 
```JavaScript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(myArray[4]);
// Output: undefined
```

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

### Solution
The code logs 1.

### Discussion
Variables declared in an outer scope can be accessed in any inner scope. In our case, the variable a is declared in the function definition and then accessed in the body of the if statement. For that reason, line 4 logs the value 1 when myFunction is invoked.

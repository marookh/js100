What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
let a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  console.log(a);
}

myFunction();
```

### Solution
The code logs `1`.

### Discussion
The variable `a` declared in the `let` statement on line 1 is declared at the very top level of our code, so it is accessible from everywhere in the code, including from within the body of `myFunction`.

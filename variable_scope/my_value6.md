What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
    let a = 2;
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

### Solution

ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization

### Discussion
Your initial hunch might have been that this code should output the numbers 1 (on line 5) and 2 (on line 7). The reason that doesn't happen is that variables declared by let aren't available until the code runs. Therefore, the let statement on line 6 creates a new variable `a` that isn't available on line 5. Since we try to log `a` before assigning it a value, a ReferenceError is raised.

Technically, the scope of `a` is the entire block. JavaScript does hoist the variables defined by let, but, when it does, it creates a "temporal dead zone" in which the variable exists but doesn't have a value -- not even a value of undefined. 

Note that the variable `a` defined on line 6 shadows the variable a defined on line 2.

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
const a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  a = 2;
}

myFunction(a);
```

### Solution

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

### Discussion
Variables declared by `const` are block scoped, similar to variables declared by `let`, but their value cannot be changed through re-assignment. So when we try to re-assign `a` to a new value on line 4, we get an error.

Note that passing `a` as an argument to `myFunction` on line 7 has no effect, as the function does not declare any parameters. It is an excess argument that is simply ignored in the function body.

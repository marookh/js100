What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';
```

### Solution
The code logs `undefined`.

### Discussion
All variables in JavaScript declared with var are hoisted, meaning they are virtually moved to the beginning of the scope. This means that our code snippet above behaves like the following one:

```JavaScript
var greeting;

console.log(greeting);

greeting = 'Hello world!'
```

When a `var` variable is declared but not assigned a value, like on line 1, it is initialized to the value `undefined`. For that reason, the code logs `undefined` to the console.

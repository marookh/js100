What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```JavaScript
let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);
```

### Solution
The code logs `false`.

### Discussion
The situation is similar to that of the previous exercise: The variable `b` declared on line 2 and the variable `b` declared on line 5 in the body of the `if` statement have the same name, but they are two different variables. Important to note is that the `b` that we reference on line 8 refers to the variable declared on line 2. This is because the scope of `b` declared on line 5 is the body of the `if` statement, and it is not accessible in any outer scope.
